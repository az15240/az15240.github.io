A collection of previous resume versions...

`rename_spaces.sh` is used for renaming the files for a better formatting issues.

E.g. previous file names are `Resume - Stanley Yang - 0321.docx`. The spaces are tricky to tackle when coming to terminals, so I decided to replace the spaces by underlines and remove extra delimiters, if necessary.


Things I learned:

`make -B <target>` will ignore timestamp checks and execute the target unconditionally.


Current problem to address: too many copies and versions of word (TBD)
