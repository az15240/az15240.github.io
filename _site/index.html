<h2 id="misc">Misc</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I am a crazy cat lover, though not currently having one. <a href="https://space.bilibili.com/298946431">Puff</a> is the cutest cat in my opinion. Her mom is an American shorthair, her dad is a Scottish Fold, and she had a younger Ragdoll cousin called Paofan.  I have tons of merch of Puff, including two pillows, two T-Shirts, a card holder, dozens of stickers, and thousands of stickers in my phone.</li>
  <li>When I am not coding or reading papers, I enjoy playing <a href="https://bloodontheclocktower.com/">board games</a>, petting cats, playing video games, doing sports, cooking, watching movies, and reading fictions. I am also a veteran LTK (Legends of the Three Kingdoms) player, in which I had once reached the top 20 globally in the 10th Anniversary server.</li>
  <li>I applied for Oxford University for undergraduate school, but I got rejected. Maybe I messed up with my interview but I was feeling ok for it. There are a MAT (Maths Admissions Test) and I got surprisingly good on it, getting a 97 out of 100 which ranks top 1% among 2816 competitors. I felt so close to Oxford but what a pity…</li>
  <li>My Chinese name is 杨光 (Yáng Guāng), which means sunshine. It is a very common Chinese name and lots of people have the same name as me. Fun fact: I have a neighbor with the exact same name (first and last!) as me.</li>
