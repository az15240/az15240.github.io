## About Me

- I am a second year undergraduate student in Computer Science at the University of Washington. I am currently in [Gilbert Bernstein](https://gilbertbernstein.com/)'s group but I'm not doing research with him. I'm also a student in the [PLSE](https://uwplse.org/) group. 
- **I'm actively looking for summer internships and research opportunities**.
- Despite early in my academic journey, I'm broadly interested in programming languages, computer graphics, theory of computing, and machine learning.
- Before college, I grew up in Wuhan, China. I am fortunate to attend Wuhan Foreign Languages School for middle school and Wuhan Britain-China School for high school; the learning experiences from both schools have given me perspective and courage to study abroad.

## Projects and Experiences

**[Flight App](https://github.com/az15240/Flight-App)**

This is an flight app based on a global airline management service. 

I designed and tested a database of airline flights, their customers, and their reservations; I also prototyped the management service which is connected to a live database (in Microsoft Azure). The prototype uses a command-line interface. and allows for concurrent usage.

--------

**[Primitive Tagging for Everyday Objects Research](https://github.com/merlinyx/primtag)**
- Developed user-in-the-loop semi-automatic methods for identifying 3D geometric primitives on an input mesh 
- Enhanced user interface for intuitive region selection and primitive type specification, benefiting novice users 
- Implemented advanced functionality to crop user-selected mesh data, optimizing for reduced mesh generation 
- Utilized differential 3D learning techniques for automatic optimization of primitive shape parameters on PyTorch

-----

**[CaCL (Change and Chance Language) Interpreter & Compiler](https://gitlab.cs.washington.edu/599o-wi24-dppl/yz489/cacl)**
- Implemented parsing, type checking, annotations, template expansions, mutations, and diverse data type support
- Authored 1300+ lines of tests, thoroughly validating interpreter functionalities and error-handling mechanisms.
- Employed compiler rewrite strategies to optimize code dependencies and boost compilation speed
- Innovative features like parallel let, short-circuiting, and higher-order functions augment language capabilities 

-----

**[uMessage chat application](https://github.com/az15240/uMessage)** 

- Implemented various data structures: MinHeap, CircularArrayFIFOQueue, MoveToFrontList, AVLTree, and ChainingHashTable
- Used the above implementations on the back-end to drive word suggestion, spelling correction, and autocompletion in the chat application called uMessage
- The chat application reads from certain files and remembers the frequency of every N-Gram, then gives word suggestion as the user types in more words.

**[Campus Path Finder](https://github.com/az15240/Campus-Path-Finder)**

Campus Path Finder for University of Washington, Seattle campus. 

This is a course project for [CSE331 in winter 2023](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse331/23wi/). More information and specs about the project can be found [here](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse331/23wi/calendar/hwlist.html). HW5 to HW9 are for this project and it took 6 weeks of development. 

- Developed a generic ADT and applied it to a campus map using Java, tested with 5000 lines of JUnit tests
- Designed a web app and utilized React and Java Spark framework to create a user-friendly GUI
- Analyzed a database comprising 5000+ campus coordinates for navigation between 52 buildings
- Applied MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern for GUI and employed Dijkstra's algorithm for navigation

------

**[Tetris](https://github.com/az15240/Tetris)**

- Developed a fully functional Tetris game in Racket, showcasing programming proficiency
- Leveraged the Racket GUI toolkit to design an engaging and interactive user interface
- Innovatively incorporated extra Tetris blocks and a cheating function to enhance gameplay and user experience

## Misc
- I am a crazy cat lover, though not currently having one. [Puff](https://space.bilibili.com/298946431) is the cutest cat in my opinion. Her mom is an American shorthair, her dad is a Scottish Fold, and she had a younger Ragdoll cousin called Paofan.  I have tons of merch of Puff, including two pillows, two T-Shirts, a card holder, dozens of stickers, and thousands of stickers in my phone. 
- When I am not coding or reading papers, I enjoy playing [board games](https://bloodontheclocktower.com/), petting cats, playing video games, doing sports, cooking, watching movies, and reading fictions. I am also a veteran LTK (Legends of the Three Kingdoms) player, in which I had once reached the top 20 globally in the 10th Anniversary server.
- I applied for Oxford University for undergraduate school, but I got rejected. Maybe I messed up with my interview but I was feeling ok for it. There are a MAT (Maths Admissions Test) and I got surprisingly good on it, getting a 97 out of 100 which ranks top 1% among 2816 competitors. I felt so close to Oxford but what a pity...
- My Chinese name is 杨光 (Yáng Guāng), which means sunshine. It is a very common Chinese name and lots of people have the same name as me. Fun fact: I have a neighbor with the exact same name (first and last!) as me.
