## About Me

- I am a third-year undergraduate student in Computer Science at the University of Washington, working with [Gilbert Bernstein](https://gilbertbernstein.com/) and as a member of the [PLSE](https://uwplse.org/) lab.
- I will be joining Amazon this summer as a Jr. SDE intern!
- Previously, I did my internship at [Amazon Web Services AI Shanghai Lablet](https://www.amazonaws.cn/en/ailab/), where I am working on the popular [Deep Graph Library (DGL) framework](https://dgl.ai/).
- Although early in my academic journey, I have broad interests in programming languages, computer graphics, theory of computing, and machine learning.
- Before college, I grew up in Wuhan, China. I was fortunate to attend Wuhan Foreign Languages School for middle school and Wuhan Britain-China School for high school; the experiences at both schools have given me the perspective and courage to study abroad.

## Teaching

- I am currently a teaching assistant for [CSE 341 & 413 Programming Languages](https://cse.uw.edu/341), having served for six consecutive quarters. The course focuses on functional programming, language design, and interpreter construction using OCaml. Other instructors have used languages such as Racket, Scheme, and Ruby. Additionally, I served as an infrastructure TA, leading grading tasks, developing autograders, and writing test scripts and cases. I also delivered a guest lecture on Static vs. Dynamic Typing, which can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbGIDZzfK5U&ab_channel=StanleyYang).

- I own the "[StanleyYang Talking about Math Video](https://weixin.qq.com/r/lx1cWa3EPmVCKOk6b0gT)" channel on WeChat, where I create and post math tutorial videos on a biweekly basis. My videos have supported the math studies of over 350 students, with a total of 26 videos.

- I was a tutor for The Sailors, a student-run tutoring group. I taught math, physics, and computer science to seven students with varying academic backgrounds and needs.

## Misc
- I am a crazy cat lover, though I don't currently have one. [Puff](https://space.bilibili.com/298946431) is the cutest cat in my opinion. Her mom is an American Shorthair, her dad is a Scottish Fold, and she has a younger Ragdoll cousin named Paofan. I have tons of Puff merch, including two pillows, two T-shirts, a cardholder, dozens of stickers, and thousands of digital stickers.
- When I'm not coding or reading papers, I enjoy playing board games (especially [social deception games](https://bloodontheclocktower.com/)), petting cats, playing video games, doing sports, cooking, watching movies, and reading fiction. I am also a veteran LTK (Legends of the Three Kingdoms) player, once ranking top 20 globally in the 10th Anniversary server.
- I applied to Oxford University for undergraduate studies but was rejected. Despite feeling good about the interview, I may have messed up. I did exceptionally well on the Maths Admissions Test (MAT), scoring 97 out of 100, ranking in the top 1% among 2,816 competitors. It felt so close, yet so far.
- My Chinese name is 杨光 (Yáng Guāng), which means sunshine. It's a common Chinese name, and many people share it. Fun fact: I have a neighbor, who is a PhD student in CSE, with the exact same name (first and last!) as mine.
- I'm happy to chat about anything! Feel free to shoot me an email. Love to make friends!
