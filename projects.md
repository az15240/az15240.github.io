## [Projects and Experiences](projects.html)


**[Scotty3D: a 3D modeling, rendering and animation package](https://gitlab.cs.washington.edu/cse557-24au/cse557-24au-students/cse557-24au-hzhao5)**

- Developed a software rasterization pipeline for GPU-independent preview renders, using OpenGL
- Designed interactive mesh editing tools using a halfedge data structure, enabling efficient topology changes
- Built a path-tracing renderer with efficient ray-scene intersection queries and realistic light simulation
- Implemented an animation system with skeletal animation, linear-blend skinning, and particle simulation

**[Primitive Tagging for Everyday Objects Research](https://github.com/merlinyx/primtag), [poster](https://github.com/merlinyx/primtag/blob/main/poster.png)**
- Developed user-in-the-loop semi-automatic methods for identifying 3D geometric primitives on an input mesh 
- Enhanced user interface for intuitive region selection and primitive type specification, benefiting novice users 
- Implemented advanced functionality to crop user-selected mesh data, optimizing for reduced mesh generation 
- Utilized differential 3D learning techniques for automatic optimization of primitive shape parameters on PyTorch

-----

**[CaCL (Change and Chance Language) Interpreter & Compiler](https://gitlab.cs.washington.edu/599o-wi24-dppl/yz489/cacl)**
- Implemented parsing, type checking, annotations, template expansions, mutations, and diverse data type support
- Authored 1300+ lines of tests, thoroughly validating interpreter functionalities and error-handling mechanisms.
- Employed compiler rewrite strategies to optimize code dependencies and boost compilation speed
- Innovative features like parallel let, short-circuiting, and higher-order functions augment language capabilities

**[Flight App](https://github.com/az15240/Flight-App)**

This is an flight app based on a global airline management service. 

I designed and tested a database of airline flights, their customers, and their reservations; I also prototyped the management service which is connected to a live database (in Microsoft Azure). The prototype uses a command-line interface. and allows for concurrent usage.


-----

**[uMessage chat application](https://github.com/az15240/uMessage)** 

- Implemented various data structures: MinHeap, CircularArrayFIFOQueue, MoveToFrontList, AVLTree, and ChainingHashTable
- Used the above implementations on the back-end to drive word suggestion, spelling correction, and autocompletion in the chat application called uMessage
- The chat application reads from certain files and remembers the frequency of every N-Gram, then gives word suggestion as the user types in more words.

**[Campus Path Finder](https://github.com/az15240/Campus-Path-Finder)**

Campus Path Finder for University of Washington, Seattle campus. 

This is a course project for [CSE331 in winter 2023](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse331/23wi/). More information and specs about the project can be found [here](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse331/23wi/calendar/hwlist.html). HW5 to HW9 are for this project and it took 6 weeks of development. 

- Developed a generic ADT and applied it to a campus map using Java, tested with 5000 lines of JUnit tests
- Designed a web app and utilized React and Java Spark framework to create a user-friendly GUI
- Analyzed a database comprising 5000+ campus coordinates for navigation between 52 buildings
- Applied MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern for GUI and employed Dijkstra's algorithm for navigation

------

**[Tetris](https://github.com/az15240/Tetris)**

- Developed a fully functional Tetris game in Racket, showcasing programming proficiency
- Leveraged the Racket GUI toolkit to design an engaging and interactive user interface
- Innovatively incorporated extra Tetris blocks and a cheating function to enhance gameplay and user experience

-----

**[“Buddies” App at DubHacks 2022 Hackathon](https://github.com/az15240/Buddies)**

This is an app that connects students around you. University students could have a lot of things to do, such as looking for a study group, inviting others to a party, or looking for a person to walk home together when it’s 12am, and so on.

I led a team of four as the Project Manager and UI/UX Designer for the App using Flutter framework. We orchestrated team brainstorming sessions, managed project timelines, and designed the GUI using Figma. We showcased our project through a video demonstration and live presentation to a panel of judges


-------

**[Seating Assignment Program](https://github.com/az15240/Seating-Assignment-Program)**

It can let the user create a seating layout and assign seats randomly for a class of students. More functionalities such as personalized grouping or splitting students are supported. 

- Designed ADTs for user accounts and seating layouts using Java, enhancing data organization
- Implemented a GUI using Java Swing, facilitating effortlessly editing and exporting of seating plans 
- Comprehensively tested with JUnit to ensure reliable application performance for a seamless user experience
- Enhanced seating arrangements with customization features, effectively lightening workload on teachers

**[FIRST Robotics Competition 2021, Team 5165: Yangtze](https://github.com/team5308/2021RCC-Alpha)**

I am a programmer for [FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) Team 5165 Yangtze, serving during the 2021 season. My responsibilities included writing the code for chassis control and PID tuning.

**[Pioneer Academics Summer Research Program](https://pioneeracademics.com/)**

I conducted an individual research project and earned college credit from Oberlin College. My research focused on the mathematics of ranking. Under the mentorship of [Timothy Chartier](https://www.davidson.edu/people/tim-chartier), Professor of Mathematics and Computer Science at Davidson College, my research titled "[An Analysis of the Codeforces Rating System](./assets/files/WHBC/An_Analysis_of_the_Codeforces_Rating_System_-_Guang_Yang.pdf)" explores the underlying algorithms and mathematical models used in the Codeforces rating system, utilizing a range of quantitative and qualitative data sources to provide an in-depth evaluation. I was rated as **"top 5%, one of the best I have encountered"** by my professor.
