<p>This is an flight app based on a global airline management
service.</p>
<p>I designed and tested a database of airline flights, their customers,
and their reservations; I also prototyped the management service which
is connected to a live database (in Microsoft Azure). The prototype uses
a command-line interface. and allows for concurrent usage.</p>

user-in-the-loop semi-automatic methods for identifying 3D geometric
primitives on an input mesh - Enhanced user interface for intuitive
region selection and primitive type specification, benefiting novice
users - Implemented advanced functionality to crop user-selected mesh
data, optimizing for reduced mesh generation - Utilized differential 3D
learning techniques for automatic optimization of primitive shape
parameters on PyTorch</p>

ChainingHashTable</li>
<li>Used the above implementations on the back-end to drive word
suggestion, spelling correction, and autocompletion in the chat
application called uMessage</li>
<li>The chat application reads from certain files and remembers the
frequency of every N-Gram, then gives word suggestion as the user types
in more words.</li>

in my opinion. Her mom is an American shorthair, her dad is a Scottish

dozens of stickers, and thousands of stickers in my phone.</li>
<li>When I am not coding or reading papers, I enjoy playing <a

playing video games, doing sports, cooking, watching movies, and reading
fictions. I am also a veteran LTK (Legends of the Three Kingdoms)
player, in which I had once reached the top 20 globally in the 10th
Anniversary server.</li>
<li>I applied for Oxford University for undergraduate school, but I got
rejected. Maybe I messed up with my interview but I was feeling ok for
it. There are a MAT (Maths Admissions Test) and I got surprisingly good
on it, getting a 97 out of 100 which ranks top 1% among 2816
competitors. I felt so close to Oxford but what a pity…</li>
